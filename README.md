## What Makes This Special
Unlike the original ClickMorph that only morphed base item versions, this remaster uses Blizzard APIs to detect exactly which variant you're viewing and applies the correct itemModID. Will continue expanding functionality as needed.

**Example:** Clicking on a Mythic helmet automatically applies the Mythic appearance, not the base version.
